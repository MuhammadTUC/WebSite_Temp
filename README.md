Business Website Temp 2023
The business template is a one-page application with navigation links that scroll the user to different sections of the page.
HTML was used to structure the content, CSS to style it, and Bootstrap to provide pre-designed styles and components.
JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior, such as smooth scrolling, dropdown menus, modals, carousels, and form validation.
The template includes sections that highlight different aspects of the business, such as the main banner, about, services, portfolio, team, testimonials, contact, and footer.
